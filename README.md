# TodoApp
 A fullstack todo app on the MERN stack.

 This is a learning project for me to explore all of the technology and ideas behind creating a full stack application.

 ## Planning

First I wanted to note down what functionality I wanted this app to have.

The app should support the following :
- Login landing page with username, password, login fields and register under that [ ]
    - Ability to register an account with a username/password [ ]
    - Ability to login to the app with this account [ ]
- Homepage which will show all Todo's that belong to this user account [ ]
    - The topbar will just have TodoApp and logout [ ]
    - Should be a 'Welcome (username)' section right before todo's begin [ ]
- Todos will render down in a list style [ ]
    - The topmost element will be dotted to denote fill in, can type in a todo and enter/green check to create [ ]
    - Existing todo's will have checkbox followed by text, with an (x) to delete the todo on rightmost [ ]
